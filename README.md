Code Academy Pro Intensive Course

This is the second project of the above course. 
Students were required to rebuild a website. 
The most recent concepts studied were Flexbox and CSS display. 
There is a heavy focus on Flexbox in the css presented here.

The assignment had some fun challenges that required constant revision.

Any feedback and suggestion will be appreciated.
