Code Academy Pro Intensive Course

This is the second project of the above course. 
Students were required to rebuild a website. 
The most recent concepts studied were Flexbox and CSS display. 
There is a heavy focus on Flexbox in the css presented here.

The assignment had some fun challenges that required constant revision.

A few questions remain:

1. Which is more recommended and why: storing images and other files in a local or a remote directory?
2. The body has a black background. There is a section called 'mission' in the html. How can it use the black background instead of assigning it a black background again?
3. From experience, is it less time consuming to use SASS to do the styling? 

Any feedback and suggestion will be appreciated.
